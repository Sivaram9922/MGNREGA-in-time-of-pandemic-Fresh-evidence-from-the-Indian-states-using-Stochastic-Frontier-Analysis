## Abstract
MGNREGA is the largest global job creation initiative, and it has been in operation in India starting 2005-06. The present study compares the efficiency level of different states of India in implementing MGNREGA during pre-pandemic and post-pandemic periods of COVID-19 (from FYI 2017-18 to FYI 2021-22). The technical efficiencies of the states are calculated using the stochastic frontier analysis(SFA) framework with the total person-days, the total new assets created as output variables and total persons work allotted, Labour expenditure, Amount sanctioned as input variables. The results indicate that during the period 2017-22, more than ten states achieved a Technical efficiency which is less than the mean technical efficiency score of all states in both the output cases. Jharkhand and Uttarakhand states turned out to be the most efficient states to create new assets. Manipur, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh states turned out to be the most inefficient states in case of creating new assets. Mizoram, Rajasthan, Meghalaya, Odisha states turned out to be most efficient, and Goa, Chhattisgarh, Assam turned out to be the least efficient in total person-days. A significant dip is observed in the mean technical efficiency scores of states in FYI 2021-22, indicating the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic in the MGNREGA implementation. Further, efficiency is positively related to literacy rates and a higher share of a marginalised population. Places such as those with a high poverty rate and low literacy can achieve greater production levels with improved programme administration.
